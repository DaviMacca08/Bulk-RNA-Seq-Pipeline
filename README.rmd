## 📌 Project Overview

**BioProject:** PRJNA1400483\
**Data source:** NCBI SRA\
**Sequencing:** Illumina NovaSeq 6000, paired-end 2 × 150 bp

This repository contains a complete and fully reproducible Bulk RNA-seq
analysis (upstream and downstream) aimed at characterizing the
transcriptional impact of OGT knockdown in the human ovarian granulosa
cell line KGN.

The analysis successfully replicates the original study, yielding highly
consistent differential expression results and biologically coherent
pathway enrichment profiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧬 Scientific Background

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation, a key
post-translational modification involved in transcriptional regulation,
cellular stress response, and signal transduction.

Two independent siRNAs targeting OGT (siOGT1 and siOGT2) and a negative
control (siNC) were used. Each condition includes two biological
replicates, resulting in a total of six transcriptomic libraries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Experimental Design

| Condition | Replicates |
|-----------|------------|
| siNC      | 2          |
| siOGT1    | 2          |
| siOGT2    | 2          |

## ⚙️ Upstream Analysis Workflow

1.  Raw data retrieval from NCBI SRA\
2.  Quality control with FastQC and MultiQC\
3.  Adapter and quality trimming using Trimmomatic\
4.  Post-trimming quality assessment\
5.  Alignment with HISAT2\
6.  BAM processing with Samtools\
7.  Gene-level quantification with featureCounts

> Poly(A) tails were intentionally preserved to remain faithful to the
> original experimental design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 Downstream Analysis Workflow

The downstream analysis was performed entirely in **R** using
**Bioconductor** packages, following the official **DESeq2 recommended
workflow** for Bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧮 1. Count matrix preparation

-   Gene-level raw counts generated by **featureCounts** were imported
    into R.\
-   Lowly expressed genes were filtered out to reduce background noise
    and improve statistical power.
-   Sample metadata were manually curated to ensure strict consistency
    between experimental conditions and the count matrix.

✔ Raw counts were preserved for all statistical analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚙️ 2. DESeq2 object construction & normalization

-   A `DESeqDataSet` object was created using **DESeq2**, specifying the
    experimental design formula:

    ```         
    ~ condition
    ```

-   Library size normalization was performed internally using the
    **median-of-ratios** method.

-   Gene-wise dispersion estimates were computed and stabilized using
    **empirical Bayes shrinkage**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📊 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analyses were conducted on **variance-stabilized transformed
(VST)** counts:

-   Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-   Sample-to-sample distance heatmaps
-   Global expression distribution assessment

These analyses demonstrated: - high concordance between biological
replicates\
- clear separation between control and OGT knockdown conditions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📈 4. Differential expression analysis

Differential expression was assessed **independently** for each
contrast:

-   **siOGT1 vs siNC**
-   **siOGT2 vs siNC**

Statistical testing was performed using:

-   Wald test
-   Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction

Genes were classified as differentially expressed if they satisfied:

-   adjusted *p*-value (`padj`) \< 0.05\
-   absolute log2 fold change \> 0.5\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧠 5. Functional enrichment analysis

Functional interpretation of DEGs was performed separately for
**upregulated** and **downregulated** gene sets using
**clusterProfiler**:

-   Gene Ontology (Biological Process)
-   Pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG / Reactome, where applicable)

Only statistically significant DEGs were used as input, and multiple
testing correction was applied to all enrichment analyses.

Enriched terms were biologically coherent with the known role of **OGT**
in transcriptional regulation, cellular stress response, and metabolic
signaling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ♻️ 6. Reproducibility & methodological standards

-   Raw counts were used **exclusively** for differential expression
    statistics.
-   Transformed data (VST) were used **only** for EDA and visualization.
-   All steps follow **Bioconductor-recommended and peer-reviewed
    workflows**.
-   Scripts are modular, ordered, and fully reproducible.
